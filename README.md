# Bank Account Opening Form
I created a Bank Account Opening Form using basic HTML form elements and table structures to organize the content into different sections such as Personal Details, Contact Details, Account Details, KYC & Nominee Details, and Declaration.
It uses basic HTML elements such as tables, input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, textarea, and file upload.
